WeatherPack Log: met-team notes.

2018-02-06: Depart Reykjavik
2018-02-09: WP3 and WP4, WD incorrect by roughly 40-90deg, WS significantly overestimated by 10-15m/s; WD then became fixed at 359deg
2018-02-10: Arrive to Akureyri. In fjord WS significantly overestimated showing 25m/s, despite displayed gust of 16m/s; WD incorrect by varying degree; In harbour WP3 and WP4 were checked and settings reviewed; After this wind readings seemed reasonable while stationary in harbour
2018-02-11: Depart Akureyri. It became clear that the software was performing poor corrections when we were underway as readings were significantly inaccurate
2018-02-13: Met team forced to start only using wind readings from ship navigation unit. Provided by propeller on mast that suffers from shading
2018-02-15: Met team decided to stop using T, P and RH data from WP3 and WP4. Significant inconsistency between the two WPs and when compared to met teamâ€™s HATPRO measurements. Used HATPRO observations for T, P, RH for initialisation of radiosondes, despite a known small bias, as they appeared more consistent.
2018-02-16: WP3 received a compass settings edit, but soon after the WD became fixed at 127deg again
2018-02-19: Heavy rainfall event with some icing resulted in total failure of both WP3 and WP4; T fixed on -30degC despite temperatures around 0degC, RH fixed on 0, P incorrect
WD and WS unrealistic. After 12 hours of temperatures above 0degC situation remained the same
2018-02-21: WP3 switched off for good due to complete lack of useful data output; WP4 retained due to periodically useful values for P, RH
2018-02-23: Arrive Isafjordur. In harbour WP3 removed and replaced with WP2 (an older model WP using a propeller and vane system for WD and WS that is known to be less accurate than modern sonic systems ought to be and less resilient to harsh conditions)
2018-02-27: Depart Isafjordur. WP2 T and RH appear to be accurate, P fixed at 800 mbar. WP2 WS and WD incorrect by seemingly systematic bias
2018-02-28: WP2 reset with new parameters. WS and WD now appear to be reasonably accurate. Met team begin using T and RH from WP2 for radiosonde initialisation, P from WP4. Met team continue using WS and WD from ship navigation unit.
2018-03-12: No change in observation system. Met team have continued to use WP2 for T and RH, WP4 for P, and ship navigation unit for WS and WD.
End of cruise: no change in system since previous comment
